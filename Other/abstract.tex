Windswept Adan is the seventh studio album by Japanese singer-songwriter Ichiko Aoba (pictured), released on 2 December 2020 by her label, Hermine.
The concept album follows the story of a young girl who is sent away by her family to the fictional island of Adan.
Aoba and composer Taro Umebayashi wrote, composed, arranged, and produced the music for the album, which was preceded by one single, "Porcelain".
Windswept Adan is a chamber folk and psychedelic folk album with elements of jazz, classical, and ambient music.

Marking a departure from Aoba's earlier minimalist instrumentation, it includes a celesta, wind chimes, string arrangements, and vocal performances.
The album received widespread critical acclaim for its arrangements, instrumentation, and worldbuilding.
Upon its release, the album debuted at number 82 on the Billboard Japan Hot Albums chart and number 88 on the Oricon Albums Chart.
Aoba supported the album with her first international tour between August and October 2022.
